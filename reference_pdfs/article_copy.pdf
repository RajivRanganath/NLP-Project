StackGAN is a sophisticated GAN model that enables the creation of photorealistic images. 
Initially, it generates lower-resolution visuals, and then in a second phase enhances them to higher quality. 
This two-stage method improves clarity and stabilizes training compared to traditional GAN approaches.
