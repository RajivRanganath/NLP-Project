Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have enabled significant advances in image synthesis that could lead to the production of high-quality, photorealistic images. 
This study explores the two-step production of high-resolution photos using StackGAN, a complex GAN model. 
The first step produces low-resolution images, which are subsequently improved in the second step to produce outputs of higher quality.
StackGAN introduces a two-stage generation process that produces low-resolution images in the initial stage and then gradually improves them within the second stage to produce high-resolution, finely detailed images.
